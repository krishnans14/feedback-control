    "In general, short post-doc research work is expected to be hyper-focused. This is because it is not easy for a candidate to look for an open problem, solve it and make it work within whatever short period available. The 1.5 years or so I spent for my postdoc at the CRAN lab had other ideas. When I started, it was not believed that we would have anything interesting and *publishable* out of it. So I had a lot less pressure and I went around looking for different ways to visualize the problem and chanced upon one interesting approach. This is a summary of what happened there in semi-technical terms. Of course, peer review would let us know if what we think is interesting is indeed so, but I can look back and say we came up with an interesting solution and got an interesting story to tell.\n",

After analyzing 100+ sensors we focused on a few of them to develop and illustrate the approach and then generalize it.\n",

Since several combinations can have the smallest norm (it happens more than we imagine, especially when there are sensor faults), we can estimate leaks not as a single point, but as a range.
