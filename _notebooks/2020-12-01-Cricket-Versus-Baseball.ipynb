    "The model was trained using image search data from Bing. However, the data was quite bad (with a lot of cartoons and unrelated images) and hence the classifier is not very good. For example, the stumps in a cricketer's image is primarily attributed to a batsman and if stumps appears in a bowler's image, it is likely to be classified as batsman.\n",

That blog entry details the step-by-step discussion on how the neural network classifier was developed using Fastai, PyTorch and Bing Image search\n",

    "In this blog entry, a very brief description of the steps that went into building this model is given, espcially to both show how we collected the images as well as the reason why this wasn't much successful by showing examples of the training data. The steps are cursory and some outputs (such as training) are not shown here (I was trying to reduce the size of the jupyter notebook and instead ended up removing all outputs).\n",
