    "When the time came to choose a programming language, I chose Python because the name was inspired by the inimitable *Monty Python*. As a *Pythonist*, I also used Monty Python as an inspiration when I wanted to learn the Python programming language. I started working on the (now paused) [RPG based on the Monty Python holy grail movie](https://github.com/krishnans14/monty-python-holy-grail-rpg) project. I learned to play around with the `pygame` module as well as a bit about the objected-oriented aspects of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had noted down a long time back that I wanted to use the contents from the remarkable website [MontyPython.net](https://www.montypython.net) in some application or the other. So when I saw a [hangman game implementation in Python on the Kite Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4nEnsavl6w), I immediately thought that I should build a hangman, but with a Monty Python theme.\n",

    "This blog entry is the story of how that came about."

    "I wanted to say a *Python Thesaurus*, the word list that provides a pool for the game to pick words from. But, given that it would be silly to prepare a world list, I decided that it should be a quote list. The MontyPython.Net had the scripts, so all I needed now were web scraping tools.  I chose `BeautifulSoup` because I liked the name (you need to decide based on some condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "I quickly realized that making sense of the quotes from the entire Monty Python content (several movies and several seasons of the show) would be daunting. So I decided to stick to the Holy Grail movie script. Another reason tied my hands too. I found it difficult to narrow down on the popular quotes (to avoid using every dialogue or description). This is when I noticed that the website admin had done something awesome:  add audio clips to famous quotes, but only for the Holy Grail movie. So I decided to focus only on those quotes that have been given an audio file. I later added a few more quotes manually into the list generated, but, web scraping using BeautifulSoup did a great job. To make sure everything went smooth, I had to circumvent problems through some quirks, but overall, I got a nice set of quotes."
